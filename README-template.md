## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

- First I will work on the 375px mobile version, I will create the necessary html elements for the form and the images, then I will give it the styles and    when the mobile version is complete I will work on the JS.

## My process - Movile

- I decided to divide this into two sections, one for the cards and one for the form, I used different nested elements because at this moment I imagine that I will solve a few problems with the absolute and relative position.

- For the form I decided to use grid, since it seemed like a good opportunity to practice it, but due to my lack of experience I lost about 5 hours because I couldn't get the input to be contained by the columns, the input overflowed and I changed the width of the columns , I solved this by placing the inputs inside a p element to contain them, the same logic that I applied with the images in a div container.

-Today I leave the project here, it is 00:32 am and tomorrow I have to work, I still have to apply the styles for the confirm section, although I have some ideas on how to do it, create a class with the property display none and exchange with Javascript this property between the form and the confirm.

-I also need to apply the requested styles for this challenge and I go to sleep praying that the code does not break when doing so.
